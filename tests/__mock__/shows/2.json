    "summary": "<p>John Reese is a former CIA operative living off the grid in NYC. When Reese is hauled into NYPD's 8th Precinct for a skirmish on the subway, he's bailed out by a man he doesn't know: Mr. Finch, a mysterious billionaire. Finch offers Reese a choice: stay on the streets and drink himself to death -- or join him in his mission to stop violent crimes before they happen. Finch has access to a secret source of information, one that identifies people who are about to be involved in violent crimes. There's just one catch: he doesn't know if these people will be the victims or the perpetrators. Skeptical but intrigued, Reese agrees to help. Together, Reese and Finch work to discover what danger is about to befall Assistant District Attorney Diane Hansen. Their actions garner the unwanted attention of NYPD homicide detective Carter -- a dedicated veteran cop who's not fond of vigilantes -- and Detective Fusco, a precinct detective who stands in the way of Reese's plans.</p>",

What does the machine know that they don't?

Fresh out of the service, Joey seems to be adjusting well to life back home. He has a good job, a beautiful girlfriend, and his whole life ahead of him. But Reese and Finch soon discover that even though Joey's off the battlefield, he's still putting himself in the line of fire. It seems Joey and his army buddies are using the skills they learned in combat to commit daring heists in New York. According to Finch's machine, Joey's about to kill or be killed -- so Reese infiltrates the group to find out which. With Detective Carter hot on his trail, Reese is closer to getting captured than ever before as he goes on a high-risk mission that puts his life -- and Finch's -- in danger.</p>",

In hot pursuit, the shooters chase them into the infamous Double B High Rises -- a city housing project that has fallen into disrepair and is now home to thugs and illegal enterprises. Reese must find a way to escape the Double B's with Charlie and get him safely across the river into Carter's hands so that Charlie can testify to what he saw and bring justice to the victim of the murder. But the mafia is dead set on killing Charlie and will stop at nothing to make sure that Charlie doesn't make it out of the Double B's alive.

When bodies start to turn up, Reese and Finch need to figure out how they are connected to this agent and why he has returned to New York City after so much time. In this game of spy vs. spy, the old school operator matches his spycraft against Reese and Finch's neo-technology.
